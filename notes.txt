  CTA:

  MISC:
✅    - Remove favicon in top left and add in js: if fixed-btn clicked, then change flex grow
    - If dateDiv has active tokens, then display it, otherwise hide the dateDiv html elements.
        -  Alternatively maybe find a way to automatically send an email if tokens get <100 uses left, so I can just create another free account and start over.
    - Work on media queries
